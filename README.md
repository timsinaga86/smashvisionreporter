# Smash Vision Reporter

This is an ongoing project where I try to use computer vision to detect winners of Smash Ultimate games and automatically report the results onto start.gg! This project is in early stages but feel free to contact me at timothy.sinaga86@gmail.com for details. 

# Steps to try it yourself

1. Go to the start.gg API documentation to learn how to generate your own authentication token: https://developer.start.gg/docs/intro
2. Add the authentication token into a .env file
3. Run 'npm install dotenv' and 'npm install node-fetch@v3.2.10'
4. Run 'node api_practice.js'

From there you can see some of the information I'm retrieving from a tournament series I run at https://start.gg/returntonorris

This will be updated as I make more progress on the project!
